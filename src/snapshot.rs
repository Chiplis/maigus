//! Unified object snapshot system.
//!
//! This module provides a comprehensive snapshot type that captures all relevant
//! object information for "last known information" (LKI) lookups. This is used when:
//!
//! - Triggers need to know what a creature looked like when it died
//! - Effects need to check characteristics of objects that have left the battlefield
//! - Resolution effects need to track target characteristics
//!
//! Per MTG rules:
//! - Rule 400.7h: LKI is used when a triggered ability refers to the characteristics
//!   of the object that triggered it but that object has left its previous zone.
//! - Rule 608.2h: If a spell or ability needs to use information about an object
//!   that has left a zone, it uses the object's last known information.
