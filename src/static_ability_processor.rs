//! Static ability processor.
//!
//! This module generates continuous effects from static abilities on permanents
//! using the trait-based `StaticAbility` system.
//!
//! # Why Some Abilities Return Empty Vectors
//!
//! Many static abilities like Flying, Vigilance, Trample, etc. return empty
//! vectors from `generate_effects()`. This is intentional:
//!
//! **Self-granting keywords** are abilities that only affect the object they're
//! on. They don't need to be converted into continuous effects because they're
//! checked directly on the Object when relevant:
//!
//! - **Flying**: Checked during declare blockers step
//! - **First Strike**: Checked during combat damage assignment
//! - **Indestructible**: Checked when destruction would occur
//! - **Hexproof**: Checked when targeting validation happens
//!
//! These are stored on the Object's `abilities` list and can be looked up with
//! trait methods like `ability.has_flying()` or through calculated
//! characteristics when continuous effects might modify them.
//!
//! **Effect-generating abilities** like Anthems ("Creatures you control get +1/+1")
//! and ability grants ("Creatures you control have flying") DO create continuous
//! effects because they affect other objects.
//!
//! # MTG Rules Reference
//!
//! Per Rule 611.3a, static abilities generate continuous effects that apply
//! dynamically to all objects matching their criteria, as opposed to resolution
//! effects which lock their targets at resolution time (Rule 611.2c).
