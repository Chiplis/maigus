//! Filter system for selecting objects in the game.
//!
//! This module provides filters for selecting objects (permanents, spells, cards)
//! based on various criteria like card types, colors, power/toughness, etc.
//!
//! Filters are used by:
//! - Target specifications (for spells and abilities that target)
//! - Effect conditions (for effects that affect "all creatures" etc.)
//! - Cost requirements (for sacrifice costs, etc.)
//! - Triggered ability conditions (for triggers that watch for specific events)

// ============================================================================
// Object Reference (for cross-effect tagging)
// ============================================================================

/// A reference to an object for use in filters and effects.
///
/// This allows effects to reference objects from prior effects in the same
/// spell/ability resolution. For example, "Destroy target permanent. Its
/// controller creates a token" - the token creation needs to reference
/// the controller of the destroyed permanent.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Target`: The first object target in the targets list (default)
/// - `Specific(ObjectId)`: A specific object by ID
/// - `Tagged(TagKey)`: An object referenced by tag from a prior effect
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Tag the destroyed permanent
/// Effect::destroy(ChooseSpec::permanent()).tag("destroyed"),
/// // Reference the tagged object's controller
/// Effect::create_tokens_player(token, 1, PlayerFilter::ControllerOf(ObjectRef::tagged("destroyed")))
