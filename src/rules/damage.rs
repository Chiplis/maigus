//! Damage calculation rules for MTG.
//!
//! This module handles damage-related rules including:
//! - Deathtouch (any damage is lethal)
//! - Lifelink (controller gains life)
//! - Infect (damage as -1/-1 counters to creatures, poison to players)
//! - Wither (damage as -1/-1 counters to creatures)
//! - Trample (excess damage goes to defending player)
